# NodeJs(Express) starter 
This repo could be used as a kind of inherited api structure, and it will save a lot of time.

## Why I made this repo
When starting a new Nodejs(express) project, I found myself implementing the same code blocks and setting up the same configurations over and over.
- Thus, after this repo, whenever I will start a new project, I will just clone it, and start implementing buisiness logic right away. 

## What this repo includes
- Babel setup for using Javascript ES6
- API folder structure
- Configured Logger module
- Authorization, Authentication, Http requests validation, Error handling middleware
- Useful utils for strings and JS objects manipulation
- Configures ESLint
